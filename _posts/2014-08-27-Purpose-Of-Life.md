Hello.
Have you ever felt so depressed for no reason at all? You just get up one fine morning and it doesn't feel quite right.Something is missing. I ask my mom and she says you got the best things in life so just stop whining!When you have carved a path for yourself.You try traversing those roads but suddenly you are thrown away far from your route for no reason at all . Now you have no clue which route to take to come back on track. I am here all alone in unknown roads with a heavy baggage having no clue where I am supposed to go in life!Should I be satisfied and content with what I have right now ? Or am I being so greedy asking for more from life?
I console myself with the cliche "Maybe something better is waiting for me".Yeah I know that is just pure bullshit but that is the only thing which is keeping me on the other side of insanity.
