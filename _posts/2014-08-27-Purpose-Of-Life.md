Hello.

Have you ever felt so depressed for no reason at all? You just get up one fine morning and it doesn't feel quite right.Something is missing. Why is that sometimes life feels so empty? Like you are closed inside a cage and you are not able to break free.I ask my mom and she says you got the best things in life so just stop whining!

You carve a path for yourself and you try traversing those roads.Suddenly you are thrown far away from your route for no reason at all . Now you have no clue which route to take to come back on track. I am here all alone in unknown roads with a heavy baggage having no clue where I am supposed to go in life!Should I be satisfied and content with what I have right now ? Or am I being so greedy asking for more from life?

I console myself with the cliche "Maybe something better is waiting for me".Yeah I know that is just pure bullshit but that is the only thing which is keeping me on the other side of insanity.I must never give up on my dreams afterall that's the only luxury I have right now , "my dreams"! They are my own and no one can snatch them away from me . 

What is the ultimate purpose of our lives ? Just preserve our species? So many questions pounding inside my head but I fail to answer them EVERY.SINGLE.TIME.
