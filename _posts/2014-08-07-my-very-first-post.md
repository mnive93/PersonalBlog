Hello.
   This is my very first blog post which is created using Jekyll . I am in love with the beauty and simplicity of my blog page ! So let's get into business ! This is going to be my personal blogpage where you get to witness all the cool side projects I am going to work on! I am currently working as an  Android developer in a company called Zoho .  I am planning to use my ample free time productively which I should have done in College but failed to do so ! So let's start!
