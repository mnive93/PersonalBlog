Hello.

So now for my first side project I am planning to develop a Chrome app which will help me dig deeper into Javascript (which I am very very weak at)! The idea of my Chrome app is something similar to that of LinkedIn Pulse app but with a twist ! You get to subscribe to many channels or even add a channel that you wish to receive updates. By channels I mean their RSS feed. So the twist is that I am planning to let you filter your news with a set of keywords which will help you stay updated in the news that you are interested in. So this is raw basic idea of my chrome app.It requires a bit of tweaking. 

<b>Obstacles </b> 

* I might be facing is to process the RSS feed of the channel.Not every channels have well        maintained RSS feed.

* Filtering the content . So in order to filter the content I might have to scrape the content of the webpage.In order to scrape the content I am planning to use a JS library to do the trick. 

* Node.js offers a good scraping library so the next obstacle is integrating Node.js with Chrome Apps.

Now I have listed down all the issues that I will be tackling . It's challenging , but hey I am doing this only for the challenge.
